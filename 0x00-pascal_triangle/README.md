# Pascal's Triangle

## Overview
This project implements a Python function to generate Pascal's Triangle of a given size `n`. Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical triangle where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The first and last numbers of each row are always 1, and each row is constructed by adding the two numbers from the row above it.

## Functionality
The project contains a Python script `pascal_triangle.py` that defines a function `pascal_triangle(n)` which generates Pascal's Triangle of size `n`.

### Function Signature:
```python
def pascal_triangle(n):
